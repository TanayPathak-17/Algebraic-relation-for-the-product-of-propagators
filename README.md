# AlgRel
The Mathematica package for finding the algebraic relations for the product of propagators. Such relations can be used to convert the original Feynman integral which can be complicated to compute, into integrals which are easier to compute.

**Installation**

After setting the path, The ***AlgRel*** package can be called using the following command
```
<<AlgRel.wl
```
The package one command : *AlgRel*. The description of the same can be found using the following command
```
?AlgRel
```

**Example file**

One example file *Examples.nb* is also provided with various one, two and three-loop examples.
