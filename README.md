# Algebraic-relation-for-the-product-of-propagators
The package AlgRel.wl can be used to find the algebraic relationa for the product of propagators. Such relations can be used to convert the original integral which can be complicated to compute into integrals which are easier to computed, via the method of functional reduction.
