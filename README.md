# AlgRel
The Mathematica package for finding the algebraic relations for the product of propagators. Such relations can be used to convert the original Feynman integral which can be complicated to compute, into integrals which are easier to compute. The work is based on following work

[𝙰𝚕𝚐𝚁𝚎𝚕.𝚠𝚕 : Algebraic Relations for the Product of Propagators in Feynman integrals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04852).

**Installation**

After setting the path, The ***AlgRel*** package can be called using the following command
```
<<AlgRel.wl
```
The package one command : *AlgRel*. The description of the same can be found using the following command
```
?AlgRel
```

**Example file**

One example file *Examples.nb* is also provided. It contains the demonstration of the package for various one, two and three-loop examples.
